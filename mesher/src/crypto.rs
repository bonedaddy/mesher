//! Rust's wrapper around its crypto engine.
//! **WARNING**: Currently intentionally very broken!
//! This crypto is NOT SECURE and should not be used in production!
//! It's intentionally easy to break so that if I need to, while debugging, I can.
//! 
//! While this is a nicer, easier-to-use wrapper around crypto primitives, using it still requires you to understand how public-key crypto works.
//! For example, if you don't know the security guarantees provided by encryption vs. signing, **do not use this wrapper**.
